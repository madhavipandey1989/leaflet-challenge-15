In this challange we got Earthquake data in north american continent from USGS apis. 
We got Earthquakes data from earthquake.usgs.gov for last 7 days in JSON format.
We tranfroed the data using D3.js library. 

We used the maps from openstreetmap.org, created circle markers and assigned the size of circle based on the magnitude of the earthquake. This way we could demomstrate the earthquake with magnitude at the exact location on the north american continent.

We have also colored the circles based on the magnitude of the earthquakes, and defined legends specifying the colors.

Files used, 
index.html: the html file loading the div and map.
logic.js: The java script file containing the logic. 
style.css: the style sheet.
